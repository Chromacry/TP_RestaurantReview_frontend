# Restaurant Review Frontend
## Heavenly Eats Restaurant Review
Heavenly Eats is an Online Restaurant Review Application. It's my year 1 second semester project in Temasek Polytechnic. I've build it where it has role level and user permission.

## What motivates me?
I needed a deliverable for my CDEV/DBAV(CODING AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT /DATABASE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT ) module and the project specification was to build a Restaurant Review Applicaiton.
